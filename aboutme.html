    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p>In my personal life I am working to Improve my grades as well as my talent in football. Experiences that lead me to this is me playing football from 5 years old to now (9th grade).

I work toward these goals every day. I come to school and prioritize my academics. I learn new things, get work done, and stay on top of my grades. I strive to get better at football every day by lifting weights, coming to practice, giving my best effort, and spending the time I have in the offseason getting better.

The values I consider most necessary for my success are hard work, discipline, and grit. I feel if I show up everyday ready to give something my all results will follow the actions.

Short term goals I hope to accomplish in the future are getting all A's in school, making and playing varsity next year, and continue getting better once our season is over.

Character traits I most want to be known for include being a leader, a hard worker, I want to be a role model when im older to other athletes, and striving to be the best I can at all times. I want to achieve a state championship,  scholarship offers for academics and football, and a captain of the football team and be someone to look up to for younger players.</p>
